The Spanish Railway dataset is a creative work of academic curiosity, a limited snapshot of one moment in history. The original creator makes no claim of ownership to any data therein, nor should be held responsible for its accuracy. Such can therefore be used as "freely" as its source. Population data is "Prepared with data extracted from the INE website: [www.ine.es](http://www.ine.es/)", apparently with no restriction on reuse beyond that statement. Municipality centroids CC BY 4.0 from [Instituto Geográfico Nacional de España](http://www.ign.es/). National network station nodes were originally from the [IDEAADIF](http://ideadif.adif.es/) (INSPIRE) dataset, apparently under the same license. 20 July 2018 operator data was researched from operator websites. Later [Renfe open data](http://data.renfe.com/legal), "Origen de los datos: Renfe Operadora".
