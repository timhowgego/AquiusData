Dataset copyright differs from the [Aquius codebase](https://github.com/timhowgego/Aquius), and no licensing guarantees of data can be given unless made explicit by all entities represented within the dataset. Be warned that no protection is afforded by the _logical nonsense_ of a public transport operator attempting to deny the public dissemination of their public operations. Nor should government-owned companies or state concessionaires be naively presumed to operate in some kind of public domain. Railways, in particular, can accumulate all manner of arcane legislation and strategic national paranoias. In the era of Google many public transport operators have grown less controlling of their information channels, but your mileage may vary.
