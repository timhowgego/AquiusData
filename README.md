# Aquius Sample Datasets

Sample datasets for use with [Aquius](https://github.com/timhowgego/Aquius).

Datasets have been split from Aquius' application code because the licensing of the data used by Aquius is often incompatible with Aquius' own MIT License.

[Browse the datasets via Github](https://github.com/timhowgego/AquiusData). Each `.json` file is a dataset. Dataset-specific licencing will be described in the directory's `LICENSE.md`. Background information and known issues may be documented in the directory's `README.md`.

Sample datasets are provided as is. They are not automatically updated for current service patterns, so are almost by definition _now_ inaccurate. If you need a current dataset, create and host your own - either [from GTFS](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/gtfs/), [GeoJSON](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/live/geojson/), or [bespoke code](https://timhowgego.github.io/Aquius/#data-structure).
